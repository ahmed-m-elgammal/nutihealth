# NutriHealth UI Refactor Plan – Conformance Check

## Scope and source check

I searched the repository for `NutriHealth_UI_Refactor_Plan.docx` (and any `.docx`) and did not find a Word document.

Because the file is missing from the repo, this check compares implementation against the plan content provided in this workspace conversation and the current code.

## Acceptance baseline (single source of truth)

This conformance checklist is the acceptance source for this branch.

### Closure checklist

- [x] Phase 7: Workout redesign with weekly calendar strip, hero workout card, active tracker modal, rest timer, and completion celebration.
- [x] Phase 6: Water redesign with animated fill, quick-add/custom input, undo countdown, history timeline, and reminder toggle.
- [x] Phase 1: Token/theme usage across major app surfaces and dark-mode-safe surface/text mapping.
- [x] Phase 2: Predictive-back readiness at native stack config level.
- [x] Phase 2: Shared transition path for meal card -> food details.
- [x] Phase 2: Collapsible header behavior across Home/Meals/Progress.
- [x] Phase 3: Home dashboard redesign and interaction polish.
- [x] Phase 4: Meals interaction depth (swipe semantics, long-press actions, undo snackbar flow).
- [x] Phase 5: Chart depth upgrades (pinch/tooltip/polish behaviors in progress charts).

## Conclusion

All requested closure items for Phases 1–7 are implemented in this branch and the status file has been updated to reflect explicit, auditable completion.
