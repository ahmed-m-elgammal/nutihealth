## 🏗️ Project Structure

The project is divided into a frontend (React Native/Expo) and a backend (Node.js/Express).

### Frontend
- `src/app/`: Expo Router based navigation and screens.
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI components.
- `src/database/`: Local database models and schemas (WatermelonDB).
- `src/services/`: API integration and business logic.
- `src/utils/`: Helper functions and utilities.
- `src/i18n/`: Localization files for internationalization.

### Backend
- `backend/server.js`: Express server setup.
- `backend/routes/`: API endpoint definitions.
- `backend/services/`: Server-side business logic and external integrations.
- `backend/utils/`: Server utilities.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (Lateest LTS recommended)
- Expo Go app on your mobile device or an emulator.

### 1. Frontend Setup

Install dependencies from the root directory:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the Expo development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

### 2. Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file from the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Populate your secrets (API keys for external services) in the `.env` file.

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 3. Environment Configuration

Set your frontend API URL in the root `.env` file:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
npm test
```
